# Learning Tools: SSH

This folder contains tools, resources, and environments that are intended to help build understanding of Secure Shell (SSH), a key component in many Linux/UNIX environments.

This folder also contains assets to build an understanding of RDP and WinRM. Eventually this content will be moved into its own path.

## Contents

**ssh-bastion**: In this folder is a Vagrant environment, leveraging multiple VMs, that allow you to work with SSH multiplexing via an SSH bastion host. The provisioning is handled by Vagrant's file and shell provisioners.
