# Learning Tools

This repository contains a variety of files and tools for learning new technologies. It is aimed at existing IT professionals who need some help coming up to speed with new technologies, products, or open source projects.

This project was forked from (https://github.com/lowescott/learning-tools). The original project provides a great platform to learn new technologies but my goals are a bit different and are focused on implementations in a complex global multi-data center environment with security standard compliance concerns. With this said, the Vagrant virtual data centers created for my labs are tailored to emulate more complex environments. Also my labs will exclusively use VirtualBox as a hypervisor as it runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux and it's FOSS.
